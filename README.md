# CMPINF 0010 Final Project
## What is the most "fun" Pittsburgh neighborhood to drive in?
We looked at different metrics about neighborhoods in Pittsburgh to determine which neighborhood would be the best to ride around in. We wanted to have the most fun but also drive a challenging course with bumps, bridges, different speeds, and different signs to look out for. On top of that, we also didn't care about the condition of our vehicle afterwards, so we looked for the most challenges overall.
